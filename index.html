                Hey there! I am a highly motivated second-year student at Northeastern University pursuing a major 
                in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Experience Design. I currently work as a Technical Assistant 
                Co-Op at Northeastern's First Year Engineering Learning and Innovation Center (FYELIC), where I help 
                students with projects in various engineering disciplines, both with software and hardware. I am an 
                active member of Northeastern's Theme Park Engineering Club where I am a liaison between the construction 
                and design teams. I am also a participant on NU's championship-winning Women's Club Water Polo Team. 
                Lastly, I enjoy working on personal projects across various Makerspaces on campus.
